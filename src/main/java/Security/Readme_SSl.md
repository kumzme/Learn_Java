The main Aim of both SSL and SSH is same, which is Encryption. Both are Cryptographic Network protocols. Let’s see how both are different from each other.

SSL – Secure Socket Layer

SSL is used to encrypt the communication between browser and server. SSL (HTTPS) is also called as security over HTTP.

In SSL, the communication can be authenticated via public-key/private-key pair.

Importance of SSL Certificate

    Secures browser-server communication
    Boost up business conversation
    Assurance for information safety
    Secure Business transaction and Customer’s financial information
    Workings on port 443
    Highly adopted by E-commerce Business, Giant Organizations, Healthcare, Social Media, Government, Banking, etc. industries.
    Increases Search Impact on Google Search Engine

    Type of SSL Certificate for browser-server security.

SSH – Secure Shell

SSH is used to encrypt the communication between two computers connected over the internet.

Network Administrators are using SSH for remote login and remote control access between two computers. SSH uses port 22 for communication security.

In SSH, the communication can be authenticated either via Public-Key/Private-Key pair or via User-Id/Password pair.

Importance of SSH?

    Admin can reset password from any location over internet.
    Admin can reboot system and network devices.
    Admin can update Software and Operating Systems from any location.
    Working on post 22.

Image: Difference Between SSL and SSH


SSH and SSL are both cryptographic protocols used for creating a secure connection to exchange confidential/sensitive data by ensuring its integrity.

SSH and SSL are build based on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and its public-private key pair.

However, although they both imply securing remote communications and data transfers, their applications are distinct:

SSH - Securing computer networks

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol designed for securing network services and communications over an unsecured network by using login and password authentication.

SSH enables the creation of a secure channel in order to remotely login to a computer system or network. Although it has SSL under the hood, SSH’s application is securing computer network tunnels.

SSL – Securing web data transfers

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a cryptographic protocol which ensures the encryption/decryption of the information exchanged between the client (browser) and the server (website).

The SSL’s application is being an essential element of an SSL Certificate, which was particularly created to protect websites and the sensitive data exchanged between the user’s browser and the web server during an SSL Connection.

In today's date everyone is aware how important Internet is in daily life. It has open an endless doors of opportunities to do those tasks in matter of minutes which were quite hectic in earlier days. Though Internet is used in several things, but that is also a fact that it has also open the doors of online threats for their users which can damage their online identity and can even end up losing money. In order to avoid hackers & eavesdroppers stealing personal information, people demands web security, which is provided through SSH & SSL.

Both of them SSH & SSL (Secure Sockets Layer & Secure Shell) are public key cryptography tunneling protocols and its aim is to offer a secure, confidential exchange of data and connection across the network & the internet. The encryption technology which is used by both of them is reliable and it’s extremely difficult for hackers to break into them.

With SSL its bit of complicated as it involves CA certificates and other things. After getting on with PKI it also needed to be configured with your services to make use of PKI for authentication instead of its internal password database. Most competent can understand SSH keys within short period of time but it takes a bit longer to know SSL keys.

One of the main difference comes up is that SSL lets us use a PKI via signed certificates & for SSH you have to exchange the key fingerprints out-of-band.

SSL enables browsers to transmit data to and from a web server in a secured cryptographic manner to make it mostly impossible for third party attackers to get between internet traffic. Whereas SSH enables networked computer 1 to provide access to a shell on networked computer 2. The user can trust that any third party attacker will not be able to decrypt the data sent between the networked computers.

SSL is a Protocol which could be implemented in the 6th Presentation Layer of the OSI Model whereas, SSH has its own transport protocol independent from SSL, so it means SSH does not use SSL under the hood.

Yes, you can use them to transfer data/files. There are two different secure file transfer protocols that are based on these two. There's FTPS, which relies on SSL for security. And then there's SFTP, which relies on SSH.

SSL & SSH, both are public key cryptography tunneling protocols and aims to secure confidential data. SSL Secure Socket Layer is a certificate for protecting data on the net, SSH, Secure Shell, is a network application used to transfer or share data with a remote computer.
